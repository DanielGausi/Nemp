<h1>Information</h1>
<p>This is a remote control for Nemp - the player you are currently listening to. Depending on several settings, you are allowed 
to do more or less with the playlist.</p> 

<h3>Player</h3>
<p>On the player page, you may have
access to common controls like 'play/pause', 'next/previous title', volume control or progress. </p>

<div style="text-align:center"><a class="button btnplaypause" title="Pause"><img src="images/pause.png" width="32" height="32" alt="pause"></a><a class="button btnstop" onclick="playercontrol_stop()" title="Stop playback"><img src="images/playback-stop.png" width="32" height="32" alt="stop"></a><a class="button btnprev" onclick="playercontrol_playprevious()" title="Play the previous title in the playlist"><img src="images/skip-backward.png" width="32" height="32" alt="backward"></a><a class="button btnnext" onclick="playercontrol_playnext()" title="Play the next title in the playlist"><img src="images/skip-forward.png" width="32" height="32" alt="forward"></a></div>

<p>It is also possible that you can download the current song.</p>
<div class="filecontrol" style="text-align:center">
	<a class="button" title="Download this title"><img src="images/download.png" width="24" height="24" alt="download"> Download</a>			
</div>

<h3>Playlist</h3>
<p>On the playlist page you can see all tracks that are currently in the playlist. In <strong>Party-Mode</strong>, you can usually just 'vote' for a file. 
</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><a class="button" title="Vote for this title"><img src="images/vote.png" width="24" height="24" alt="vote this file"></a></div>

<p>Voting for a file means <i>'I like this file, and I want to hear it soon'</i>. 
Tracks with many votes will be played earlier than tracks with less or no votes. On the playlist page you can see the amount
of votes for every file (if there are any). You can vote for a file more than once, but only once per minute. All votes for a track will be deleted, when the playback of this track begins. 
</p>
<p>On a more private party, where the DJ trusts you, you may have more options to control the playlist, like 'play now',
moving files up/down or deleting files from the playlist.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<a class="button"><img src="images/playback-start.png" width="24" height="24" alt="play now"></a><a class="button"><img src="images/move-up.png" width="24" height="24" alt="move up"></a><a class="button"><img src="images/move-down.png" width="24" height="24" alt="move down"></a><a class="button"><img src="images/delete.png" width="24" height="24" alt="delete"></a>
</div>


<h3>Library</h3>
<p>On the library page you can browse in the available medialibrary. You can browse by artist, album or genre, or just search for something you like.
The search is fault-tolerant. So, if you have some typos, the system may find something matching anyway.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><a class="button" title="Vote for this title"><img src="images/vote.png" width="24" height="24" alt="vote this file"></a></div>
<p>If you vote for a file in your search results, it will be added to the playlist. If it is already in the playlist, the copy in the playlist will get another vote from you.
</p>
<p>Again, on a private party, you may have more options, e.g. 'Add the file to the playlist' or 'Add it after the current title'.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<a class="button"><img src="images/add.png" width="24" height="24" alt="Add to playlist"></a><a class="button"><img src="images/addnext.png" width="24" height="24" alt="Add to playlist"></a>
</div>

<h3>File details</h3>
<p>When you click on a track in the playlist or library page, you will see more details for the selected track (e.g. duration or bitrate). 
Behind the artist (and the album name) you may find a small search symbol:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<a class="button"><img src="images/search.png" width="16" height="16" alt="search"></a>
</div>
<p>Click on this icon to get other tracks from this artist (on this album, respectively).</p>
<p>You may also have some other icons on these pages, like the ones on the overview list.</p>
