Nemp has a lot of&nbsp;features. Some of them are very useful (or at
least: I find them very useful), but some of them may change files
automatically or search something online.<br>


<br>


I think, that these features should be OPT-IN. I don't want a player to
change the ID3-Tags of my files without my permission. I don't like
software searching&nbsp;updates all the time or downloading stuff from
the internet without my permission.<br>

<br>


Therefore the Nemp wizard was included, which will be opened when you
start Nemp for the first time. The wizard will ask you to allow the
following actions:<br>


<ol>


  <li>Check for updates: Nemp will download a small text file from my
website to check for updates (once per week or more often, if you
want). No personal data will be sent, and the only thing I see will be "<span style="font-style: italic;">1337 hits on updates.txt</span>" in my server statistics.</li>


  <li>Changing meta data: Nemp uses the meta data ("ID3-Tags") of the
audio files to save some data. You can change these data quite easy -
for the user rating you will need just one click - so it may happen by
accident. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Players like Windows Media Player or iTunes will do this all the time without asking.</span></li>


  <li>Automatic rating: Nemp can change the rating of your files
automatically: If you frequently play a song, Nemp will assume, that
you like this song. On the other side, if you abort a song, you
probably don't like it that much. This rating will be written into the
meta data of the file.</li>


  <li>Download missing cover art: If no cover art is found for an
audio file, Nemp can try to download it using the last.fm webservice.
The cover art will be stored in the Nemp cover directory, and as a "<span style="font-style: italic;">front (NempAutoCover).jpg</span>" (or *.png) into the directory of the audio file.</li>


  <li>Nemp as the default player: Register Nemp as the default player for audio files.</li>


</ol>


If the wizard is cancelled at any time, nothing of the above will be done.<br>


<br>


You can change all these settings later by starting the wizard again through the menu, or using the complete settings dialog.
