To Scrobble is a concept of LastFM - a social network with focus on
music. Scrobling means, to&nbsp;share the information what you are
currently listening to with your friends. LastFM will analyse your
taste of music and recommends other users with a similar one.<br>

<br>

You can scrobble with Nemp.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure Nemp for
scrobbling</span><br>

At first Nemp needs access to your user profile on LastFM: Choose
Settings -&gt; LastFM and click the Button "Start" and follow the
instructions.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate scrobbling</span><br>

Within teh settings dialog you can choose to scrobble just the current
session (scrobble until you close Nemp), or to scrobble always.
Scrobbling will start after click on the "Ok" button.<br>

When Nemp is scrobbling your playlist, there will be an icon <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" src="scrobbler.png" alt=""> in the main window. You can stop scrobbling by a
click on this icon.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What does Nemp do while
scrobbling?</span><br>

Scrobbling consists of to stages.<br>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

  <li>The "Now-Playing"-message. Every time a new track starts,
nemp will notify LastFM. On your LastFM profile will appear something
like&nbsp;"currently listens to&nbsp;&lt;current
track&gt;".</li>

  <li>The "Submission"-Message. This notification is sent at the
end of a track. Note that Nemp will only "submit" the track, if at
least 50% (or 4 minutes, whatever occurs first) of the track has been
played. Short tracks (less than 30 seconds) are completely&nbsp;
ignored. After a submit the track will appear in your history on LastFM.</li>

</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Troubleshooting</span><br>

Sometimes scrobbling doesn't work properly. Nemp will stop scrobbling
in these cases.
Possible error sources are<br>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

  <li>No internet connection</li>

  <li>A firewall is blocking Nemp</li>

  <li>The LastFM session key is invalid. You should restart the
configuration to get a new session key.</li>

  <li>Your account was blocked. You should contact LastFM for
further assistance.</li>

</ul>

When you think, that you have fixed the source of error, you can click
on "Scrobble again" in the settings dialog to try again..<br>
