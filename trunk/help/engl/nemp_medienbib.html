Nemp can search your computer for audio files and organize them in the
Nemp media library. This library can be sorted by several criteria, so
that you can browse in your music collection. Through the Quicksearch
feature you have a very fast access to specific files.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Search for audio files,
building the media library<br>

</span>Choose "Medialibrary -&gt; Scan harddisk for audio
files" and select your music directory. Nemp will then search this
directory (and all of its subdirectories) and add all audio files into
the media library.<br>

This may take some time, Nemp can analyse approximately 20-40 files per
second, mostly depending on the disk speed.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Browsing the media library</span><br>

Nemp offers three ways of browsing in your media library. You can
switch between them with these three Buttons in the top left of the
main window.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 72px; height: 24px;" alt="browsebuttons" src="TabBtnBrowse.png"><br>

</div>

<br>

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">"classic view"</span>
is named "classic", as it was the first mode (and the only one in
earlier Versions). The files in your library are sorted by two criteria
(e.g. Artist+Album or Year+Artist). In the left part you can find all
(e.g.) Artists. After selecting one artist, the right part displays all
(e.g.) Albums from this artist (this includes samplers with at least on
track from this artist). The title list (bootom part of the main
window) shows you all titles by the selected artist.<br>

By selecting an specific album on the right part, you can limit the
title list to the titles on this album.<br>

By "Browse by -&gt; ..." on the context menu you can choose the
sorting criteria.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

</span>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Coverflow"</span>
displays all your albums in a - yes, really! - coverflow. Nemp tries to
find a matching cover for each of your audiofiles. For this you should
have organized your file structure by albums (in some way). Nemp will
search the directory of the audiofile for image files, and if there is
a file named (e.g.) "front.jpg", it will assume that this is a proper
cover art for the audio file. (The exact procedure is a little bit more
complex, but that should be enough here). Some audio filesmay have
embedded cover art - this one will be preferred by Nemp.<br>

If no cover art can be found, Nemp can try to find a proper image
online, using the LastFM webservice.<br>

<br>

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Tagcloud"</span>
puts all the information like Artist, Album, Genre, Year, Decade, ...
together in one big list and displays the most common used. If you
resize the main window, the tag cloud can display more tags. <br>

Click on a tag will show you all titles with this tag. After a
doubleclick a new tag cloud is build considering only these titles, so
you can refine your search - e.g. all "Female Vocalists" from the "90s"
doing "Alternative Rock".<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Quicksearch</span><br>

If you want to listen to a specific song, you can use the quicksearch.
Just start typing the title and/or artist, album, filename of the song.
<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Tipp: The default
setting gives you only exact matches of your search "while you type".
If you hit the Enter key, Nemp will do an additional fuzzy search. This
will find e.g. titles from "P!nk" if you search for "Pink", and it will
ignore some typos (Do you know how many r, s and t are correct in
"Alanis Morisette"?).<br style="font-style: italic;">

</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Form the media library into the playlist</span><br>

You can add a single track, a list of tracks or a complete album into
the playlist by using the context menu or drag&amp;drop. If you use
a double click on one item in the title list, the default action is
executed (Player settings -&gt; Playlist)<br>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

  <li>Enqueue at the end of the playlist: Just add the file to
the playlist</li>

  <li>Play (and clear current playlist) deletes the current
playlist and starts a new one with the selected file(s)</li>

  <li>Enqueue after the current track inserts the selected
file(s) after the currently plaing track</li>

  <li>Just play focussed &nbsp;file starts playback of the
focussed file without changing the playlist. After the playback is
complete, Nemp will proceed with the playlist.</li>

</ul>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Tipp: Drag&amp;Drop
also works from Nemp to external programs. So you can copy some files
just by Drag&amp;Drop from Nemp to the Windows Explorer.</span><br>
