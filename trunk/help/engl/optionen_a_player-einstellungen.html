Configure the player according to your preferences. Some of the
settings should be quite clear and are not mentioned here.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Output devices</span><br>

If you use the "default" setting, Nemp will always use the default
sound device on your system and switch instantly the playback, if you
change the setting in the Windows Control Panel. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fading</span><br>

Nemp can fade between the tracks. Useful for many cases, but not recommended for
live recordings or classical music.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Tip: For a fading
between two tracks
without any silence, you should use "Silence detection" with a treshold
of -20dB (or even -10dB) and a fading time of 4000ms on title change.<br>

<br>

</span>
<h3>Playlist</h3>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">Default action for
audio files </span>is
used when you hit the enter key (or double click) after selecting a
title in the title list of the media library to add it into the
playlist.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">Default setting for
headset </span>is used when you click the button <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="headsetbtn" src="BtnHeadsetToPlaylist.png" align="middle"> to add
the current headphone file into the playlist.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Remember track position
when playing a song directly from the library</span>
is used when you choose the "Just play" option above. When the "just
played" track is completely played (or aborted by the user), Nemp will
continue at the exact position of the previously played track.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Tip: Use this to preview
a track without changing the the playlist itself.</span><br>

<br>

<h3>Webstreams</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Parse stream
playlist&nbsp;</span><br>

Many webradio stations offer you a *.pls file to tune in. In fact, this
is a well known format to store playlists (and supported by Nemp).
Quite often these pls files contains a list of several servers.
Sometimes all servers will stream the same content, but maybe with a
different quality setting or encoding.<br>

Nemp can parse the pls file and add all the servers to the playlist, or
Nemp can just add the pls file itself to the playlist, and the server
is choosen automatically.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Recording settings</span><br>

Configure, where Nemp should save the webradio recordings and how the
files should be named.<br>

The setting "Save different title in separate files" will only work, if
the radio station includes proper tags into the stream. Nemp will not
recognize a new title by analyzing the audio data.<br>

You may also want to split the files just by size or duration. Note
that these values or not exact values - the duration (or size) of the
resulting files may vary from the given values by a few seconds
(kilobytes).<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Nemp supports
recording only for mp3 or aac encoded streams. Radio stations using
Windows Media or Ogg-Vorbis can not be recorded with Nemp.</span><br>

<br>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing playback speed</span><br>

You can increase or decrease the speed of the playback. The default
method for changing the speed will also change the pitch. This sounds
quite funny, but is not always wanted. Therefore Nemp can change the
playback speed without changing the pitch.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jingles, Push-to-talk</span><br>

Configure how the main volume is reduced while playing jingles (F9) or
using the push-to-talk feature (F8).<br>

<br>

<h3>Events</h3>

The Birthday mode is a little Nemp specific gimmick: Select a time, at
which the specified title should be played (e.g. "Happy Birthday.mp3"
at midnight, when you give a party at the eve of your birthday). Nemp
will suspend the playlist automatically, play the birthday song and
proceed with the playlist aftwards. <br>

In addition, you may choose a "countdown-title" before the actual
event. The start time of the countdown track is determined
automatically.<br>
