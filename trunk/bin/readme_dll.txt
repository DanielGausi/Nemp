The dll-files contained in this directory are NOT all covered by the GPL.

- The KBHook.dll is closed source, as I lost the code for it.
  Maybe I will find it again someday. 
  It implements a shellhook for hooking multimediakeys. 

- Most of the bass*.dll are covered by the bass-license, see 
  http://www.un4seen.com for details. Some of them may be covered 
  by other licenses.
  It is believed that distribution of these files in this way may 
  qualify as "fair use".

- the bass_aac.dll is covered by the GPL.
