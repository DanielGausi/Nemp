The "Audio Tools Library" is published under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).

I tried to contact the MAC-Team for permission to (re)distribute 
the AWB under a dual-licence. I've got no answer.

As the ATL-project seems to be dead for a few years, the used
parts from there are quite small, and I personally want to allow
use of the AWB in closed source software (for beginners ;-)), 
I decided to distribute the AWB under a dual licence without
explicit permission from the developers of the ATL.
