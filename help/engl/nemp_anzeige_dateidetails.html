When you select a file in the playlist or in the media library, you can
choose "Properties" from the context menu. There you can see more
detailed information about the file.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span><br>

On the first page you can find the information stored in the media
library for this file. Through the button "Explorer" you can open the
file in the Windows Explorer, and throught the button "Properties" you
will get the Windows-Property dialog for this file.<br>

Via "Refresh" Nemp will reread the ID3-Tags (or other types of
metadata) and refresh the stored information in the media library.<br>

Additionally you can see all the images Nemp has found for this file on
your harddisk. A Doubleclick on the image will open it in your
defaultimage viewer.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Id3-Tags (mp3) / Vorbis
Comments (ogg, flac) / ...</span><br>

The second page gives you a more detailed view on the file. Note that
not all types of audio files supports metadata (e.g. wav) and that Nemp
does not support all types of metadata (e.g. wma). Right now Nemp
supports ID3-Tags (found in mp3 files), Ogg-Vorbis (*.ogg), Flac-
Comments (*.flac), Apev2-Tags (e.g. *.ape, *.mpc) and iTunes-Tags
(*.m4a).<br>

You can edit the information, which is written into the file after
click on the button "Apply".<br>

The button "Reset rating" will reset the rating of the file back to 0,
which will appear as 2.5 stars. In case the rating of the
file&nbsp;in the media library is different from the rating stored
in the metadata of the file, you will see a button to synchronize the
rating.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrics &amp; Pictures</span><br>

Nemp can store lyrics and cover art directly into the file (cover art
not supported for *.ogg). The lyrics can be downloaded from
lyrics.wikia.com automatically, or (if theyare not available there)
edited manually.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">MP3- and ID3-Details</span><br>

This is some nerdy stuff. Only the ID3v2-Version may be of interest. If
it is 2.4.0, Windows may have some problems reading the metadata from
the file. Most of the mp3-files should have the version 2.3.0.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tags for tagcloud<br>

</span>Nemp can store additional Tags in to the file, which may
not be useful for other players. These "Additional Tags" are used for
the tagcloud. You may enter some alternative genres, or personal
information as "Holiday 2011/12". <br>
