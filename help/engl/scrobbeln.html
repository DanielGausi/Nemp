<span style="font-style: italic;">To scrobble</span> is a concept of&nbsp;last.fm - a social network with focus on
music. Scrobling means to&nbsp;share the information what you are
currently listening to with your friends.&nbsp;last.fm will then analyse your
taste of music and recommends you other users with a similar one to find more music you may enjoy.<br>



<br>



You can scrobble with Nemp.<br>



<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure Nemp for
scrobbling</span><br>



At first Nemp needs access to your user profile on&nbsp;last.fm: Choose
<span style="font-style: italic;">Settings -&gt;&nbsp;last.fm</span> click the button "<span style="font-style: italic;">Start</span>", and follow the
instructions.<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate scrobbling</span><br>



Within the settings dialog you can choose to scrobble just the current
session (scrobble until you close Nemp), or to scrobble always.
Scrobbling will start after click on the "Ok" button.<br>



When Nemp is scrobbling your playlist, there will be an icon <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" src="scrobbler.png" alt=""> in the main window. You can stop scrobbling by a
click on this icon.<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">What does Nemp do while
scrobbling?</span><br>



Scrobbling consists of two stages.<br>



<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">



  <li>The "<span style="font-style: italic;">Now-Playing</span>"-message. Every time a new track starts, Nemp will notify&nbsp;last.fm. On your LastFM profile will appear something
like&nbsp;"&lt;your name&gt; currently listens to&nbsp;&lt;current
track&gt;".</li>



  <li>The "<span style="font-style: italic;">Submission</span>"-Message.
This notification is sent at the
end of a track.&nbsp;Nemp will only "submit" the track, if at
least 50% (or 4 minutes, whatever occurs first) of the track has been
played (as it is recommended by&nbsp;last.fm). Short tracks (less than 30
seconds) are completely ignored. After a submit the track will appear
in your history on&nbsp;last.fm.</li>



</ul>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Troubleshooting</span><br>



Sometimes scrobbling doesn't work properly. Nemp will stop scrobbling
in these cases.
Possible error sources are<br>



<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">



  <li>No internet connection</li>



  <li>A&nbsp;firewall is blocking Nemp</li>



  <li>The&nbsp;last.fm session key is invalid. You should restart the
configuration to get a new session key.</li>



  <li>Your account was blocked. You should contact&nbsp;last.fm for
further assistance.</li>



</ul>



When you think, that you have fixed the source of error, you can click
on "<span style="font-style: italic;">Scrobble again</span>" in the settings dialog to try again.<br>
